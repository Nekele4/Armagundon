Arcade-like game made by me

It's a 2, 3, and 4 player game to come. 
It's still in the works, because I've been working on it for a like two days.
I use the defold engine for making games as it can do most stuff.

/////////Description//////////

It will be a local multiplayer game that can have up to 4 players it's gonna give you an arcade like feeling because of it's old school gameplay features.
It will also be a platformer, it will have upgrades, weapons and much more.
I'm planning all of this and also I am hoping to add more skins to the players and online multiplayer.
